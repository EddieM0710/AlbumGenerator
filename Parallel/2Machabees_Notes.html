<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="11:21"> <A HREF="2Machabees.html#11:21">chap. 11 ver. 21</A> 
In the year 148. . .Viz., according to the computation followed by the Greeks; which was different from that of the Hebrews, followed by the writer of the first book of Machabees.

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="12:15"> <A HREF="2Machabees.html#12:15">chap. 12 ver. 15</A>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="12:46"> <A HREF="2Machabees.html#12:46">chap. 12 ver. 46</A> 
It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead. . .Here is an evident and undeniable proof of the practice of praying for the dead under the old law, which was then strictly observed by the Jews, and consequently could not be introduced at that time by Judas, their chief and high priest, if it had not been always their custom.</FONT></TD>

Mingling. . .with the heathens; that is, in their idolatrous worship.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="14:41"> <A HREF="2Machabees.html#14:41">chap. 14 ver. 41</A> 
He struck himself, etc. . .St. Augustine, (Epist. 61, ad Dulcitium, et lib. 2, cap. 23, ad Epist. 2, Gaud.) discussing this fact of Razias, says, that the holy scripture relates it, but doth not praise it, as to be admired or imitated, and that either it was not well done by him, or at least not proper in this time of grace.</FONT></TD>

No prophecy of scripture is made by private interpretation. . .This shows plainly that the scriptures are not to be expounded by any one's private judgment or private spirit, because every part of the holy scriptures were written by men inspired by the Holy Ghost, and declared as such by the Church; therefore they are not to be interpreted but by the Spirit of God, which he hath left, and promised to remain with his Church to guide her in all truth to the end of the world.  Some may tell u s, that many of our divines interpret the scriptures:  they may do so, but they do it always with a submission to the judgment of the Church, and not otherwise.</FONT></TD>

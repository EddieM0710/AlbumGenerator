Most tender, etc. . .He appeared like one tender and weak, but was indeed most valiant and strong.  It seems the Latin has here given the interpretation of the Hebrew name of the hero, to whom Jesbaham was like, instead of the name itself, which was Adino the Eznite, one much renowned of old for his valour.</FONT></TD>

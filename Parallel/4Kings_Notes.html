<H2>THE FOURTH BOOK OF KINGS</H2>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="1:10"> <A HREF="4Kings.html#1:10">chap. 1 ver. 10</A> 
Let fire, etc. . .Elias was inspired to call for fire from heaven upon these captains, who came to apprehend him; not out of a desire to gratify any private passion; but to punish the insult offered to religion, to confirm his mission, and to shew how vain are the efforts of men against God, and his servants, whom he willeth to protect.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="1:17"> <A HREF="4Kings.html#1:17">chap. 1 ver. 17</A>

They worshipped him. . .viz., with an inferior, yet religious veneration, not for any temporal, but spiritual excellency.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="2:24"> <A HREF="4Kings.html#2:24">chap. 2 ver. 24</A> 
Cursed them. . .This curse, which was followed by so visible a judgment of God, was not the effect of passion, or of a desire of revenging himself; but of zeal for religion, which was insulted by these boys, in the person of the prophet; and of a divine inspiration:  God punishing in this manner the inhabitants of Bethel, (the chief seat of the calf worship,) who had trained up their children in a prejudice against the true religion and its ministers.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="3:25"> <A HREF="4Kings.html#3:25">chap. 3 ver. 25</A>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="4:29"> <A HREF="4Kings.html#4:29">chap. 4 ver. 29</A>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="4:31"> <A HREF="4Kings.html#4:31">chap. 4 ver. 31</A> 
St. Augustine considers a great mystery in this miracle wrought by the prophet Eliseus, thus:  By the staff sent by his servant is figured the rod of Moses, or the Old Law, which was not sufficient to bring mankind to life then dead in sin.  It was necessary that Christ himself should come, and by taking on human nature, become flesh of our flesh, and restore us to life.  In this Eliseus was a figure of Christ, as it was necessary that he should come himself to bring the dead child to life and restore him to his mother, who is here, in a mystical sense, a figure of the Church.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="4:39"> <A HREF="4Kings.html#4:39">chap. 4 ver. 39</A> 
Wild gourds of the field. . .Colocynthidas.  They are extremely bitter, and therefore are called the gall of the earth; and are poisonous if taken in a great quantity.</FONT></TD>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:19"> <A HREF="4Kings.html#5:19">chap. 5 ver. 19</A> 
Go in peace. . .What the prophet here allowed, was not an outward conformity to an idolatrous worship; but only a service which by his office he owed to his master:  who on all public occasions leaned on him:  so that his bowing down when his master bowed himself down was not in effect adoring the idols:  nor was it so understood by the standers by, since he publicly professed himself a worshipper of the only true and living God, but it was no more than doing a civil office to the king his master, whose leaning upon him obliged him to bow at the same time that he bowed.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="6:18"> <A HREF="4Kings.html#6:18">chap. 6 ver. 18</A> 
Blindness. . .The blindness here spoken of was of a particular kind, which hindered them from seeing the objects that were really before them; and represented other different objects to their imagination:  so that they no longer perceived the city of Dothan, nor were able to know the person of Eliseus; but were easily led by him, whom they took to be another man, to Samaria.  So that he truly told them, this is not the way, neither is this the city, etc., because he spoke with relation to the way and to the city, which was represented to them.</FONT></TD>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="8:10"> <A HREF="4Kings.html#8:10">chap. 8 ver. 10</A> 
Tell him:  thou shalt recover. . .By these words the prophet signified that the king's disease was not mortal:  and that he would recover if no violence were used.  Or he might only express himself in this manner, by way of giving Hazael to understand that he knew both what he would say and do; that he would indeed tell the king he should recover; but would be himself the instrument of his death.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="8:16"> <A HREF="4Kings.html#8:16">chap. 8 ver. 16</A>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="8:26"> <A HREF="4Kings.html#8:26">chap. 8 ver. 26</A>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="10:18"> <A HREF="4Kings.html#10:18">chap. 10 ver. 18</A>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="13:19"> <A HREF="4Kings.html#13:19">chap. 13 ver. 19</A> 
If thou hadst smitten, etc. . .By this it appears that God had revealed to the prophet that the king should overcome the Syrians as many times as he should then strike on the ground; but as he had not at the same time revealed to him how often the king would strike, the prophet was concerned to see that he struck but thrice.</FONT></TD>

<H2>THE APOCALYPSE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE</H2>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="1:1"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#1:1">chap. 1 ver. 1</A> 
The things which must shortly come;. . .and again it is said, ver. 3, The time is at hand. . .This can not be meant of all the things prophesied in the Apocalypse, where mention is made also of the day of judgment, and of the glory of heaven at the end of the world.  That some things were to come to pass shortly, is evident, by what is said to the Seven Churches, chap. 2 and 3, Or that the persecutions foretold should begin shortly.  Or that these words signified, that all time is short, a nd that from the coming of Christ, we are now in the last age or last hour.  See 1 John 2.18.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="1:8"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#1:8">chap. 1 ver. 8</A> 
I am Alpha and Omega. . .These are the names of the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, and signify the same as what follows: The beginning and the end:  the first cause and last end of all beings: who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty. . .These words signify the true God only, and are here applied to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who is to come again to judge the living and the dead.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="2:26"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#2:26">chap. 2 ver. 26</A> 
Power over the nations. . .This shews, that the saints, who are with Christ our Lord in heaven, receive power from him to preside over nations and provinces, as patrons; and shall come with him at the end of the world to execute his will against those who have not kept his commandments.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="3:14"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#3:14">chap. 3 ver. 14</A> 
The Amen,. . .that is, the true one, the Truth itself; the Word and Son of God.  The beginning. . .that is, the principle, the source, and the efficient cause of the whole creation.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:8"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#5:8">chap. 5 ver. 8</A> 
The prayers of saints. . .Here we see that the saints in heaven offer up to Christ the prayers of the faithful upon earth.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="6:2"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#6:2">chap. 6 ver. 2</A> 
White horse. . .He that sitteth on the white horse is Christ, going forth to subdue the world by his gospel.  The other horses that follow represent the judgments and punishment that were to fall on the enemies of Christ and his church.  The red horse signifies war; the black horse, famine; and the pale horse (which has Death for its rider), plagues or pestilence.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="6:9"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#6:9">chap. 6 ver. 9</A> 
Under the altar. . .Christ, as man, is this altar, under which the souls of the martyrs live in heaven, as their bodies are here deposited under our altars.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="6:10"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#6:10">chap. 6 ver. 10</A> 
Revenge our blood. . .They ask not this out of hatred to their enemies, but out of zeal for the glory of God, and a desire that the Lord would accelerate the general judgment, and the complete beatitude of all his elect.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="9:1"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#9:1">chap. 9 ver. 1</A> 
A star full. . .This may mean the fall and apostasy of great and learned men from the true faith.  Or a whole nation falling into error and separating from the church, not having the sign of God in their foreheads.  And there was given to him the key of the bottomless pit. . .That is, to the angel, not to the fallen star.  To this angel was given the power, which is here signified by a key, of opening hell.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="9:3"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#9:3">chap. 9 ver. 3</A> 
There came out locusts. . .These may be devils in Antichrist's time, having the appearance of locusts, but large and monstrous, as here described.  Or they may be real locusts, but of an extraordinary size and monstrous shape, such as were never before seen on earth, sent to torment those who have not the sign (or seal) of God on their foreheads.  Some commentators by these locusts understand heretics, and especially those heretics, that sprung from Jews, and with them denied the divinity of Jesus Christ; as Theodotus, Praxeas, Noetus, Paul of Samosata, Sabellius, Arius, etc.  These were great enemies of the Christian religion; they tormented and infected the souls of men, stinging them like scorpions, with the poison of their heresies.  Others have explained these locusts, and other animals, mentioned in different places throughout this sacred and mystical book, in a most absurd, fanciful, and ridiculous manner; they make Abaddon the Pope, and the locusts to be friars mendicant , etc.  Here it is thought proper, not to enter into any controversy upon that subject, as the inventors of these fancies have been already answered, and fully refuted by many controvertists:  besides, those who might be inposed on by such chimerical writers, are in these days much better informed.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="10:7"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#10:7">chap. 10 ver. 7</A> 
Declared. . .literally evangelized, to signify the good tidings, agreeable to the Gospel, of the final victory of Christ, and of that eternal life, which should be the reward of the temporal sufferings of the martyrs and faithful servants of God.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="11:3"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#11:3">chap. 11 ver. 3</A> 
My two witnesses. . .It is commonly understood of Henoch and Elias.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="12:1"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#12:1">chap. 12 ver. 1</A> 
A woman. . .The church of God.  It may also, by allusion, be applied to our blessed Lady.  The church is clothed with the sun, that is, with Christ:  she hath the moon, that is, the changeable things of the world, under her feet:  and the twelve stars with which she is crowned, are the twelve apostles:  she is in labour and pain, whilst she brings forth her children, and Christ in them, in the midst of afflictions and persecutions.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="13:1"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#13:1">chap. 13 ver. 1</A> 
A beast. . .This first beast with seven heads and ten horns, is probably the whole company of infidels, enemies and persecutors of the people of God, from the beginning to the end of the world.  The seven heads are seven kings, that is, seven principal kingdoms or empires, which have exercised, or shall exercise, tyrannical power over the people of God; of these, five were then fallen, viz.:  the Egyptian, Assyrian, Chaldean, Persian, and Grecian monarchies:  one was present, viz., the emp ire of Rome:  and the seventh and chiefest was to come, viz., the great Antichrist and his empire.  The ten horns may be understood of ten lesser persecutors.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="13:3"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#13:3">chap. 13 ver. 3</A> 
One of his heads, etc. . .Some understand this of the mortal wound, which the idolatry of the Roman empire (signified by the sixth head) received from Constantine; which was, as it were, healed again by Julian the Apostate.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="13:6"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#13:6">chap. 13 ver. 6</A> 
His tabernacle, etc. . .That is, his church and his saints.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="13:8"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#13:8">chap. 13 ver. 8</A> 
Slain from the beginning, etc. . .In the foreknowledge of God; and inasmuch as all mercy and grace, from the beginning, was given in view of his death and passion.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="13:11"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#13:11">chap. 13 ver. 11</A> 
Another beast. . .This second beast with two horns, may be understood of the heathenish priests and magicians; the principal promoters both of idolatry and persecution.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="13:18"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#13:18">chap. 13 ver. 18</A> 
Six hundred sixty-six. . .The numeral letters of his name shall make up this number.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="14:8"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#14:8">chap. 14 ver. 8</A> 
Babylon. . .By Babylon may be very probably signified all the wicked world in general, which God will punish, and destroy after the short time of this mortal life:  or it may signify every great city wherein enormous sins and abominations are daily committed; and that when the measure of its iniquities is full, the punishments due to its crimes are poured on it.  It may also be some city of the description in the text, that will exist, and be destroyed, as here described, towards the end o f the world.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="14:13"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#14:13">chap. 14 ver. 13</A> 
Die in the Lord. . .It is understood of the martyrs who die for the Lord.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="16:16"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#16:16">chap. 16 ver. 16</A> 
Armagedon. . .That is, the hill of robbers.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="17:5"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#17:5">chap. 17 ver. 5</A> 
A mystery. . .That is, a secret; because what follows of the name and title of the great harlot is to be taken in a mystical sense. Babylon. . .Either the city of the devil in general; or, if this place be to be understood of any particular city, pagan Rome, which then and for three hundred years persecuted the church; and was the principal seat both of empire and idolatry.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="17:8"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#17:8">chap. 17 ver. 8</A> 
The beast which thou sawest. . .This beast which supports Babylon, may signify the power of the devil:  which was and is not, being much limited by the coming of Christ, but shall again exert itself under Antichrist.  The seven heads of this beast are seven mountains or empires, instruments of his tyranny; of which five were then fallen. (See chap. 13.1, and below, ver. 10.)  The beast itself is said to be the eighth, and is of the seven; because they all act under the devil, and by his in stigation, so that his power is in them all, yet so as to make up, as it were, an eighth empire, distinct from them all.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="17:12"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#17:12">chap. 17 ver. 12</A> 
Ten kings. . .Ten lesser kingdoms, enemies also of the church of Christ: which, nevertheless, shall be made instruments of the justice of God for the punishment of Babylon.  Some understand this of the Goths, Vandals, Huns, and other barbarous nations, that destroyed the empire of Rome.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="19:10"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#19:10">chap. 19 ver. 10</A> 
I fell down before, etc. . .St. Augustine (lib. 20, contra Faust, c. 21) is of opinion, that this angel appeared in so glorious a manner, that St. John took him to be God; and therefore would have given him divine honour had not the angel stopped him, by telling him he was but his fellow servant.  St. Gregory (Hom. 8, in Evang.) rather thinks that the veneration offered by St. John, was not divine honour, or indeed any other than what might lawfully be given; but was nevertheless refused b y the angel, in consideration of the dignity to which our human nature had been raised, by the incarnation of the Son of God, and the dignity of St. John, an apostle, prophet, and martyr.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="20:2"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#20:2">chap. 20 ver. 2</A> 
Bound him, etc. . .The power of Satan has been very much limited by the passion of Christ:  for a thousand years; that is, for the whole time of the New Testament; but especially from the time of the destruction of Babylon or pagan Rome, till the new efforts of Gog and Magog against the church, towards the end of the world.  During which time the souls of the martyrs and saints live and reign with Christ in heaven, in the first resurrection, which is that of the soul to the life of glory; as the second resurrection will be that of the body, at the day of the general judgment.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="21:1"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#21:1">chap. 21 ver. 1</A> 
The first heaven and the first earth was gone. . .being changed, not as to their substance, but in their qualities.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="21:17"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#21:17">chap. 21 ver. 17</A> 
The measure of a man, i.e., According to the measure of men, and used by the angel. . .This seems to be the true meaning of these words.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="22:10"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#22:10">chap. 22 ver. 10</A> 
For the time is at hand. . .That is, when compared to eternity, all time and temporal things vanish, and are but of short duration.  As to the time when the chief predictions should come to pass, we have no certainty, as appears by the different opinions, both of the ancient fathers and late interpreters.  Many think that most things set down from the 4th chapter to the end, will not be fulfilled till a little time before the end of the world.  Others are of opinion, that a great part of t hem, and particularly the fall of the wicked Babylon, happened at the destruction of paganism, by the destruction of heathen Rome, and its persecuting heathen emperors.  Of these interpretations, see Aleazar, in his long commentary; see the learned Bossnet, bishop of Meaux, in his treatise on this Book; and P. Alleman, in his notes on the same Apocalypse, tom. 12, who in his Preface says, that this, in a great measure, may be now looked upon as the opinion followed by the learned men.  In fine, others think that St. John's design was in a mystical way, by metaphors and allegories, to represent the attempts and persecutions of the wicked against the servants of God, the punishments that should in a short time fall upon Babylon, that is, upon all the wicked in general:  the eternal happiness and reward, which God had reserved for the pious inhabitants of Jerusalem, that is, for his faithful servants, after their short trials and the tribulations of this mortal life.  In the mean time w e meet with many profitable instructions and admonitions, which we may easily enough understand: but we have no certainty when we apply these predictions to particular events:  for as St. Jerome takes notice, the Apocalypse has as many mysteries as words, or rather mysteries in every word.  Apocalypsis Joannis tot habet Sacramenta quot verba--parum dixi, in verbis singulis multiplices latent intelligentiae.  Ep. ad Paulin, t. 4. p. 574.  Edit.  Benedict.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="22:11"> <A HREF="Apocalypse.html#22:11">chap. 22 ver. 11</A> 
Let him hurt still. . .It is not an exhortation, or license to go on in sin; but an intimation, that how far soever the wicked may proceed, their progress shall quickly end, and then they must expect to meet with proportionable punishments.</FONT></TD>

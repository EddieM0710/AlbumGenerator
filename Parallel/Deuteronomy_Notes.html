<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="13:13"> <A HREF="Deuteronomy.html#13:13">chap. 13 ver. 13</A>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="15:4"> <A HREF="Deuteronomy.html#15:4">chap. 15 ver. 4</A> 
There shall be no poor, etc. . .It is not to be understood as a promise, that there should be no poor in Israel, as appears from ver. 11, where we learn that God's people would never be at a loss to find objects for their charity:  but it is an ordinance that all should do their best endeavours to prevent any of their brethren from suffering the hardships of poverty and want.</FONT></TD>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="17:8"> <A HREF="Deuteronomy.html#17:8">chap. 17 ver. 8</A> 
If thou perceive, etc. . .Here we see what authority God was pleased to give to the church guides of the Old Testament, in deciding, without appeal, all controversies relating to the law; promising that they should not err therein; and surely he has not done less for the church guides of the New Testament.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="22:6"> <A HREF="Deuteronomy.html#22:6">chap. 22 ver. 6</A>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="22:8"> <A HREF="Deuteronomy.html#22:8">chap. 22 ver. 8</A> 
Battlement. . .This precaution was necessary, because all their houses had flat tops, and it was usual to walk and to converse together upon them.</FONT></TD>

Eunuch. . .By these are meant, in the spiritual sense, such as are barren in good works.  Ibid.  Into the church. . .That is, into the assembly or congregation of Israel, so as to have the privilege of an Israelite, or to be capable of any place or office among the people of God.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="23:14"> <A HREF="Deuteronomy.html#23:14">chap. 23 ver. 14</A> 
No uncleanness. . .This caution against suffering any filth in the camp, was to teach them to fly the filth of sin, which driveth God away from the soul.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="23:20"> <A HREF="Deuteronomy.html#23:20">chap. 23 ver. 20</A> 
To the stranger. . .This was a dispensation granted by God to his people, who being the Lord of all things, can give a right and title to one upon the goods of another.  Otherwise the scripture everywhere condemns usury, as contrary to the law of God, and a crying sin.  See Ex. 22.25; Lev. 25.36, 37; 2 Esd. 5.7; Ps. 14.5; Ezech. 18.8, 13, etc.</FONT></TD>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="25:17"> <A HREF="Deuteronomy.html#25:17">chap. 25 ver. 17</A> 
Amalec. . .This order for destroying the Amalecites, in the mystical sense, sheweth how hateful they are to God, and what punishments they are to look for from his justice, who attack and discourage his servants when they are but just come out, as it were, of the Egypt of this wicked world and being yet weak and fainthearted, are but beginning their journey to the land of promise.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="26:5"> <A HREF="Deuteronomy.html#26:5">chap. 26 ver. 5</A> 
The Syrian. . .Laban.  See Gen. 27.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="28:2"> <A HREF="Deuteronomy.html#28:2">chap. 28 ver. 2</A> 
All these blessings, etc. . .In the Old Testament, God promised temporal blessings to the keepers of his law, heaven not being opened as yet; and that gross and sensual people being more moved with present and sensible things.  But in the New Testament the goods that are promised us are spiritual and eternal; and temporal evils are turned into blessings.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="28:15"> <A HREF="Deuteronomy.html#28:15">chap. 28 ver. 15</A> 
All these curses, etc. . .Thus God dealt with the transgressors of his law in the Old Testament:  but now he often suffers sinners to prosper in this world, rewarding them for some little good they have done, and reserving their punishment for the other world.</FONT></TD>

The drunken, etc., absumat ebria sitientem. . .It is a proverbial expression, which may either be understood, as spoken by the sinner, blessing, that is, flattering himself in his sins with the imagination of peace, and so great an abundance as may satisfy, and as it were, consume all thirst and want:  or it may be referred to the root of bitterness, spoken of before, which being drunken with sin may attract, and by that means consume, such as thirst after the like evils.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="29:29"> <A HREF="Deuteronomy.html#29:29">chap. 29 ver. 29</A> 
Secret things, etc. . .As much as to say, secret things belong to, and are known to, God alone; our business must be to observe what he has revealed and manifested to us, and to direct our lives accordingly.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="33:8"> <A HREF="Deuteronomy.html#33:8">chap. 33 ver. 8</A>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="33:9"> <A HREF="Deuteronomy.html#33:9">chap. 33 ver. 9</A> 
Who hath said, etc. . .It is the duty of the priestly tribe to prefer God's honour and service before all considerations of flesh and blood: in such manner as to behave as strangers to their nearest akin, when these would withdraw them from the business of their calling.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="33:12"> <A HREF="Deuteronomy.html#33:12">chap. 33 ver. 12</A>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="33:23"> <A HREF="Deuteronomy.html#33:23">chap. 33 ver. 23</A>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="33:27"> <A HREF="Deuteronomy.html#33:27">chap. 33 ver. 27</A>

Man hath nothing more, etc. . .Viz., as to the life of the body.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="3:21"> <A HREF="Ecclesiastes.html#3:21">chap. 3 ver. 21</A> 
Who knoweth, etc. . .Viz., experimentally:  since no one in this life can see a spirit.  But as to the spirit of the beasts, which is merely animal, and become extinct by the death of the beast, who can tell the manner it acts so as to give life and motion, and by death to descend downward, that is, to be no more?</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="7:4"> <A HREF="Ecclesiastes.html#7:4">chap. 7 ver. 4</A> 
Anger. . .That is, correction, or just wrath and zeal against evil.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="7:17"> <A HREF="Ecclesiastes.html#7:17">chap. 7 ver. 17</A> 
Over just. . .Viz., By an excessive rigour in censuring the ways of God in bearing with the wicked.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="7:18"> <A HREF="Ecclesiastes.html#7:18">chap. 7 ver. 18</A> 
Be not overmuch wicked. . .That is, lest by the greatness of your sin you leave no room for mercy.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="7:30"> <A HREF="Ecclesiastes.html#7:30">chap. 7 ver. 30</A>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="8:15"> <A HREF="Ecclesiastes.html#8:15">chap. 8 ver. 15</A> 
No good for a man, etc. . .Some commentators think the wise man here speaks in the person of the libertine:  representing the objections of these men against divine providence, and the inferences they draw from thence, which he takes care afterwards to refute.  But it may also be said, that his meaning is to commend the moderate use of the goods of this world, preferably to the cares and solicitudes of worldlings, their attachment to vanity and curiosity, and presumptuously diving into the unsearchable ways of divine providence.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="9:5"> <A HREF="Ecclesiastes.html#9:5">chap. 9 ver. 5</A> 
Know nothing more. . .Viz., as to the transactions of this world, in which they have now no part, unless it be revealed to them; neither have they any knowledge or power now of doing any thing to secure their eternal state, (if they have not taken care of it in their lifetime:) nor can they now procure themselves any good, as the living always may do, by the grace of God.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="11:3"> <A HREF="Ecclesiastes.html#11:3">chap. 11 ver. 3</A> 
If the tree fall, etc. . .The state of the soul is unchangeable when once she comes to heaven or hell:  and a soul that departs this life in the state of grace, shall never fall from grace:  as on the other side, a soul that dies out of the state of grace, shall never come to it.  But this does not exclude a place of temporal punishments for such souls as die in the state of grace:  yet not so as to be entirely pure:  and therefore they shall be saved, indeed, yet so as by fire.  1 Cor. 3. 13, 14, 15.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="12:2"> <A HREF="Ecclesiastes.html#12:2">chap. 12 ver. 2</A>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="12:13"> <A HREF="Ecclesiastes.html#12:13">chap. 12 ver. 13</A>

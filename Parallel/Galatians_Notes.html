<H2>THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS</H2>

The gospel of the uncircumcision. . .The preaching of the gospel to the uncircumcised, that is, to the Gentiles.  St. Paul was called in an extraordinary manner to be the apostle of the Gentiles; St. Peter, besides his general commission over the whole flock, (John 21. 15, etc.,) had a peculiar charge of the people of the circumcision, that is, of the Jews.</FONT></TD>

I withstood, etc. . .The fault that is here noted in the conduct of St. Peter, was only a certain imprudence, in withdrawing himself from the table of the Gentiles, for fear of giving offence to the Jewish converts; but this, in such circumstances, when his so doing might be of ill consequence to the Gentiles, who might be induced thereby to think themselves obliged to conform to the Jewish way of living, to the prejudice of their Christian liberty.  Neither was St. Paul's reprehending him any argument against his supremacy; for in such cases an inferior may, and sometimes ought, with respect, to admonish his superior.</FONT></TD>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="4:3"> <A HREF="Galatians.html#4:3">chap. 4 ver. 3</A> 
Under the elements, etc. . .That is, under the first rudiments of religion, in which the carnal Jews were trained up; or under those corporeal creatures, used in their manifold rites, sacrifices, and sacraments.</FONT></TD>

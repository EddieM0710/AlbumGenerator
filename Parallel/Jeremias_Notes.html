Shall iron be allied, etc. . .Shall the iron, that is, the strength of Juda, stand against the stronger iron of the north, that is, of Babylon:  or enter into an alliance upon equal footing with it?  No certainly:  but it must be broken by it.</FONT></TD>

Let them be confounded, etc. . .Such expressions as these in the writings of the prophets, are not to be understood as imprecations proceeding from malice or desire of revenge:  but as prophetic predictions of evils that were about to fall upon impenitent sinners, and approbations of the ways of divine justice.</FONT></TD>

Thou hast deceived, etc. . .The meaning of the prophet, is not to charge God with any untruth; but what he calls deceiving, was only the concealing from him, when he accepted of the prophetical commission, the greatness of the evils which the execution of that commission was to bring upon him.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="20:12"> <A HREF="Jeremias.html#20:12">chap. 20 ver. 12</A>

The dove. . .This is commonly understood of Nabuchodonosor, whose military standard, it is said, was a dove.

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="36:30"> <A HREF="Jeremias.html#36:30">chap. 36 ver. 30</A>

The sons of God. . .The angels.--Ibid.  Satan also, etc.  This passage represents to us in a figure, accommodated to the ways and understandings of men, 1. The restless endeavours of Satan against the servants of God; 2. That he can do nothing without God's permission; 3. That God doth not permit him to tempt them above their strength:  but assists them by his divine grace in such manner, that the vain efforts of the enemy only serve to illustrate their virtue and increase their merit.</FONT></TD>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="19:6"> <A HREF="Job.html#19:6">chap. 19 ver. 6</A> 
With an equal judgment. . .St. Gregory explains these words thus:  Job being a just man, and truly considering his own life, thought that his affliction was greater than his sins deserved:  and in that respect, that the punishment was not equal, yet it was just, as coming from God, who gives a crown of justice to those who suffer for righteousness' sake, and proves the just with tribulations, as gold is tried by fire.</FONT></TD>

Ver. 25, 26, and 27 shew Job's explicit belief in his Redeemer, and also of the resurrection of the flesh, not as one tree riseth in place of another, but that the selfsame flesh shall rise at the last day, by the power of God, changed in quality but not in substance, every one to receive sentence according to his works in this life.</FONT></TD>

Acceptable to the gravel of Cocytus. . .The Hebrew word, which St. Jerome has here rendered by the name Cocytus, (which the poets represent as a river in hell,) signifies a valley or a torrent:  and in this place, is taken for the low region of death and hell:  which willingly, as it were, receives the wicked at their death:  who are ushered in by innumerable others that have gone before them; and are followed by multitudes above number.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="26:13"> <A HREF="Job.html#26:13">chap. 26 ver. 13</A>

The words of Job are ended.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="32:21"> <A HREF="Job.html#32:21">chap. 32 ver. 21</A> 
I will not level God with man. . .Here Eliu considers that Job hath put himself on a level with God, by the manner he assumed to justify his own life in speaking to God as if he spoke to an equal:  Eliu expresses in the following ver. 22 his fear of punishment hereafter for such an attempt.</FONT></TD>

He sealeth up, etc. . .When he sends those showers of his strength, that is, those storms of rain, he seals up, that is, he shuts up the hands of men from their usual works abroad, and confines them within doors, to consider his works; or to forecast their works, that is, what they themselves are to do.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="37:20"> <A HREF="Job.html#37:20">chap. 37 ver. 20</A> 
He shall be swallowed up. . .All that man can say when he speaks of God, is so little and inconsiderable in comparison with the subject, that man is lost, and as it were swallowed up in so immense an ocean.</FONT></TD>

Spoken inconsiderately. . .If we discuss all Job's words (saith St. Gregory), we shall find nothing impiously spoken; as may be gathered from the words of the Lord himself, chap. 42, ver. 7, 8; but what was reprehensible in him, was the manner of expressing himself at times, speaking too much of his own affliction, and too little of God's goodness towards him, which here he acknowledges as inconsiderate.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="40:10"> <A HREF="Job.html#40:10">chap. 40 ver. 10</A>

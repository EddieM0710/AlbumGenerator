<H2>THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. JOHN</H2>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="2:4"> <A HREF="John.html#2:4">chap. 2 ver. 4</A> 
What is that to me, etc. . .These words of our Saviour, spoken to his mother, have been understood by some commentators as harsh, they not considering the next following verse:  Whatsoever he shall say to you, do ye, which plainly shows that his mother knew of the miracle that he was to perform, and that it was at her request he wrought it; besides the manner of speaking the words as to the tone, and the countenance shown at the same time, which could only be known to those who were presen t, or from what had followed:  for words indicating anger in one tone of voice, would be understood quite the reverse in another.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="3:5"> <A HREF="John.html#3:5">chap. 3 ver. 5</A> 
Unless a man be born again, etc. . .By these words our Saviour hath declared the necessity of baptism; and by the word water it is evident that the application of it is necessary with the words.  Matt. 28. 19.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="3:18"> <A HREF="John.html#3:18">chap. 3 ver. 18</A> 
Is not judged. . .He that believeth, viz., by a faith working through charity, is not judged, that is, is not condemned; but the obstinate unbeliever is judged, that is, condemned already, by retrenching himself from the society of Christ and his church.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="3:19"> <A HREF="John.html#3:19">chap. 3 ver. 19</A> 
The judgment. . .That is, the cause of his comdemnation.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="3:21"> <A HREF="John.html#3:21">chap. 3 ver. 21</A> 
He that doth truth. . .that is, he that acteth according to truth, which here signifies the Law of God.  Thy law is truth.  Psa. 118. 142.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="4:20"> <A HREF="John.html#4:20">chap. 4 ver. 20</A> 
This mountain. . .Garizim, where the Samaritans had their schismatical temple.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:2"> <A HREF="John.html#5:2">chap. 5 ver. 2</A> 
Probatica. . .That is, the sheep pond; either so called, because the sheep were washed therein, that were to be offered up in sacrifice in the temple, or because it was near the sheep gate.  That this was a pond where miracles were wrought is evident from the sacred text; and also that the water had no natural virtue to heal, as one only of those put in after the motion of the water was restored to health; for if the water had the healing quality, the others would have the like benefit, be ing put into it about the same time.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:29"> <A HREF="John.html#5:29">chap. 5 ver. 29</A> 
Unto the resurrection of judgment. . .That is, condemnation.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:39"> <A HREF="John.html#5:39">chap. 5 ver. 39</A> 
Or. . .You search the scriptures.  Scrutamini. . .It is not a command for all to read the scriptures; but a reproach to the Pharisees, that reading the scriptures as they did, and thinking to find everlasting life in them, they would not receive him to whom all those scriptures gave testimony, and through whom alone they could have that true life.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="6:44"> <A HREF="John.html#6:44">chap. 6 ver. 44</A> 
Draw him. . .Not by compulsion, nor by laying the free will under any necessity, but by the strong and sweet motions of his heavenly grace.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="6:54"> <A HREF="John.html#6:54">chap. 6 ver. 54</A> 
Except you eat--and drink, etc. . .To receive the body and blood of Christ, is a divine precept, insinuated in this text; which the faithful fulfil, though they receive but in one kind; because in one kind they receive both body and blood, which cannot be separated from each other.  Hence, life eternal is here promised to the worthy receiving, though but in one kind.  Ver. 52.  If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever; and the bread that I will give, is my flesh for the life of the world.  Ver. 58.  He that eateth me, the same also shall live by me.  Ver. 59.  He that eateth this bread, shall liver for ever.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="6:63"> <A HREF="John.html#6:63">chap. 6 ver. 63</A> 
If then you shall see, etc. . .Christ by mentioning his ascension, by this instance of his power and divinity, would confirm the truth of what he had before asserted; and at the same time correct their gross apprehension of eating his flesh, and drinking his blood, in a vulgar and carnal manner, by letting them know he should take his whole body living with him to heaven; and consequently not suffer it to be as they supposed, divided, mangled, and consumed upon earth.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="6:64"> <A HREF="John.html#6:64">chap. 6 ver. 64</A> 
The flesh profiteth nothing. . .Dead flesh separated from the spirit, in the gross manner they supposed they were to eat his flesh, would profit nothing.  Neither doth man's flesh, that is to say, man's natural and carnal apprehension, (which refuses to be subject to the spirit, and words of Christ,) profit any thing.  But it would be the height of blasphemy, to say the living flesh of Christ (which we receive in the blessed sacarament, with his spirit, that is, with his soul and divinity) profiteth nothing.  For if Christ's flesh had profitedus nothing, he would never have taken flesh for us, nor died in us nothing, he would never have taken flesh for us, nor died in the flesh for us.  Are spirit and life. . .By proposing to you a heavenly sacrament, in which you shall receive, in a wonderful manner, spirit, grace, and life, in its very fountain.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="9:39"> <A HREF="John.html#9:39">chap. 9 ver. 39</A> 
I am come, etc. . .Not that Christ came for that end, that any one should be made blind:  but that the Jews, by the abuse of his coming, and by their not receiving him, brought upon themselves this judgment of blindness.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="9:41"> <A HREF="John.html#9:41">chap. 9 ver. 41</A> 
If you were blind, etc. . .If you were invincibly ignorant, and had neither read the scriptures, nor seen my miracles, you would not be guilty of the sin of infidelity:  but now, as you boast of your knowledge of the scriptures, you are inexcusable.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="10:30"> <A HREF="John.html#10:30">chap. 10 ver. 30</A> 
I and the Father are one. . .That is, one divine nature, but two distinct persons.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="12:8"> <A HREF="John.html#12:8">chap. 12 ver. 8</A> 
See the annotation of St. Matt. 26. 11.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="12:39"> <A HREF="John.html#12:39">chap. 12 ver. 39</A> 
They could not believe. . .Because they would not, saith St. Augustine, Tract. 33, in Joan.  See the annotation, St. Mark 4. 12.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="13:1"> <A HREF="John.html#13:1">chap. 13 ver. 1</A> 
Before the festival day of the pasch. . .This was the fourth and last pasch of the ministry of Christ, and according to the common computation, was in the thirty-third year of our Lord:  and in the year of the world 4036.  Some chronologers are of opinion that our Saviour suffered in the thirty-seventh year of his age:  but these different opinions on this subject are of no consequence.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="13:27"> <A HREF="John.html#13:27">chap. 13 ver. 27</A> 
That which thou dost, do quickly. . .It is not a license, much less a command, to go about his treason:  but a signification to him that Christ would not hinder or resist what he was about, do it as soon as he pleased:  but was both ready and desirous to suffer for our redemption.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="14:16"> <A HREF="John.html#14:16">chap. 14 ver. 16</A> 
Paraclete. . .That is, a comforter:  or also an advocate; inasmuch as by inspiring prayer, he prays, as it were, in us, and pleads for us.  For ever. . .Hence it is evident that this Spirit of Truth was not only promised to the persons of the apostles, but also to their successors through all generations.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="14:26"> <A HREF="John.html#14:26">chap. 14 ver. 26</A> 
Teach you all things. . .Here the Holy Ghost is promised to the apostles and their successors, particularly, in order to teach them all truth, and to preserve them from error.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="14:28"> <A HREF="John.html#14:28">chap. 14 ver. 28</A> 
For the Father is greater than I. . .It is evident, that Christ our Lord speaks here of himself as he is made man:  for as God he is equal to the Father. (See Phil. 2.)  Any difficulty of understanding the meaning of these words will vanish, when the relative circumstances of the text here are considered:  for Christ being at this time shortly to suffer death, signified to his apostles his human nature by these very words: for as God he could not die.  And therefore as he was both God and man, it must follow that according to his humanity he was to die, which the apostles were soon to see and believe, as he expresses, ver. 29.  And now I have told you before it come to pass:  that when it shall come to pass, you may believe.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="15:26"> <A HREF="John.html#15:26">chap. 15 ver. 26</A> 
Whom I will send. . .This proves, against the modern Greeks, that the Holy Ghost proceedeth from the Son, as well as from the Father: otherwise he could not be sent by the Son.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="16:8"> <A HREF="John.html#16:8">chap. 16 ver. 8</A> 
He will convince the world of sin, etc. . .The Holy Ghost, by his coming brought over many thousands, first, to a sense of their sin in not believing in Christ.  Secondly, to a conviction of the justice of Christ, now sitting at the right hand of his Father.  And thirdly, to a right apprehension of the judgment prepared for them that choose to follow Satan, who is already judged and condemned.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="16:13"> <A HREF="John.html#16:13">chap. 16 ver. 13</A> 
Will teach you all truth. . .See the annotation on chap. 14. ver. 26.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="19:14"> <A HREF="John.html#19:14">chap. 19 ver. 14</A> 
The parasceve of the pasch. . .That is, the day before the paschal sabbath.  The eve of every sabbath was called the parasceve, or day of preparation.  But this was the eve of a high sabbath, viz., that which fell in the paschal week.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="20:19"> <A HREF="John.html#20:19">chap. 20 ver. 19</A> 
The doors were shut. . .The same power which could bring Christ's whole body, entire in all its dimensions, through the doors, can without the least question make the same body really present in the sacrament; though both the one and the other be above our comprehension.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="20:23"> <A HREF="John.html#20:23">chap. 20 ver. 23</A> 
Whose sins, etc. . .See here the commission, stamped by the broad seal of heaven, by virtue of which the pastors of Christ's church absolve repenting sinners upon their confession.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="21:17"> <A HREF="John.html#21:17">chap. 21 ver. 17</A> 
Feed my sheep. . .Our Lord had promised the spiritual supremacy to St. Peter; St. Matt. 16. 19; and here he fulfils that promise, by charging him with the superintendency of all his sheep, without exception; and consequently of his whole flock, that is, of his own church.</FONT></TD>

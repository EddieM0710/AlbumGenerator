Arphaxad. . .He was probably the same as is called Dejoces by Herodotus; to whom he attributes the building of Ecbatana, the capital city of Media.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="1:5"> <A HREF="Judith.html#1:5">chap. 1 ver. 5</A> 
Nabuchodonosor. . .Not the king of Babylon, who took and destroyed Jerusalem, but another of the same name, who reigned in Ninive:  and is called by profane historians Saosduchin.  He succeeded Asarhaddan in the kingdom of the Assyrians, and was contemporary with Manasses king of Juda.</FONT></TD>

The church. . .That is, the synagogue or place where they met for prayer.</FONT></TD>

Simeon the son of Ruben. . .In the Greek, it is the son of Israel.  For Simeon the patriarch, from whom Judith descended, was not the son, but the brother of Ruben.  It seems more probable that the Simeon and the Ruben here mentioned are not the patriarchs:  but two of the descendants of the patriarch Simeon:  and that the genealogy of Judith, recorded in this place, is not carried up so high as the patriarchs.  No more than that of Elcana the father of Samuel, 1 Kings 1.1, and that of kin g Saul, 1 Kings 9.1.</FONT></TD>

Gavest him a sword, etc. . .The justice of God is here praised, in punishing by the sword of Simeon the crime of the Sichemites:  and not the act of Simeon, which was justly condemned by his father, Gen. 49.5. Though even with regard to this act, we may distinguish between his zeal against the crime committed by the ravishers of his sister, which zeal may be considered just:  and the manner of his punishing that crime, which was irregular and excessive.</FONT></TD>

Because I knew, etc. . .In this and the following chapter, some things are related to have been said by Judith, which seem hard to reconcile with truth.  But all that is related in scripture of the servants of God is not approved by the scripture; and even the saints in their good enterprises may sometimes slip into venial sins.</FONT></TD>

An anathema of oblivion. . .That is, a gift or offering made to God, by way of an everlasting monument, to prevent the oblivion or forgetting so great a benefit.</FONT></TD>

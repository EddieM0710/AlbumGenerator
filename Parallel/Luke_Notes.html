 Of the course of Abia. . .that is, of the rank of Abia, which word in the Greek is commonly put for the employment of one day:  but here for the functions of a whole week.  For, by the appointment of David, 1 Par. 24., the descendants from Aaron were divided into twenty-four families, of which the eighth was Abia, from whom descended this Zachary, who at this time was in the week of his priestly functions.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="1:48"> <A HREF="Luke.html#1:48">chap. 1 ver. 48</A> 
Shall call me blessed. . .These words are a prediction of that honour which the church in all ages should pay to the Blessed Virgin.  Let Protestants examine whether they are any way concerned in this prophecy.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="1:69"> <A HREF="Luke.html#1:69">chap. 1 ver. 69</A>

The Orient. . .It is one of the titles of the Messias, the true light of the world, and the sun of justice.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="2:7"> <A HREF="Luke.html#2:7">chap. 2 ver. 7</A> 
Her firstborn. . .The meaning is, not that she had afterward any other child; but it is a way of speech among the Hebrews, to call them also the firstborn, who are the only children.  See annotation Matt. 1. 25.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="2:34"> <A HREF="Luke.html#2:34">chap. 2 ver. 34</A> 
For the fall, etc. . .Christ came for the salvation of all men; but here Simeon prophesies what would come to pass, that many through their own wilful blindness and obstinacy would not believe in Christ, nor receive his doctrine, which therefore would be ruin to them:  but to others a resurrection, by their believing in him, and obeying his commandments.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="3:23"> <A HREF="Luke.html#3:23">chap. 3 ver. 23</A> 
Who was of Heli. . .St. Joseph, who by nature was the son of Jacob, (St. Matt. 1. 16,) in the account of the law, was son of Heli.  For Heli and Jacob were brothers, by the same mother; and Heli, who was the elder, dying without issue, Jacob, as the law directed, married his widow:  in consequence of such marriage, his son Joseph was reputed in the law the son of Heli.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="6:1"> <A HREF="Luke.html#6:1">chap. 6 ver. 1</A> 
The second first sabbath. . .Some understand this of the sabbath of Pentecost, which was the second in course among the great feasts: others, of a sabbath day that immediately followed any solemn feast.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="7:29"> <A HREF="Luke.html#7:29">chap. 7 ver. 29</A>

One of the Pharisees:  that is, Simon.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="7:47"> <A HREF="Luke.html#7:47">chap. 7 ver. 47</A> 
Many sins are forgiven her, because she hath loved much. . .In the scripture an effect sometimes seems attributed to one only cause, when there are divers other concurring dispositions; for the sins of this woman, in this verse, are said to be forgiven, because she loved much: but (ver. 50) Christ tells her, Thy faith hath made thee safe.  Hence in a true conversion are joined faith, hope, love, sorrow for sin, and other pious dispositions.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="8:10"> <A HREF="Luke.html#8:10">chap. 8 ver. 10</A> 
Seeing they may not see. . .See the annotation, Mark 4. 12.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="10:21"> <A HREF="Luke.html#10:21">chap. 10 ver. 21</A> 
He rejoiced in the Holy Ghost. . .That is, according to his humanity he rejoiced in the Holy Ghost, and gave thanks to his eternal Father.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="11:46"> <A HREF="Luke.html#11:46">chap. 11 ver. 46</A> 
Woe to you lawyers. . .He speaks of the doctors of the law of Moses, commonly called the scribes.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="11:47"> <A HREF="Luke.html#11:47">chap. 11 ver. 47</A> 
Woe to you who build, etc. . .Not that the building of the monuments of the prophets was in itself blameworthy, but only the intention of these unhappy men, who made use of this outward shew of religion and piety, as a means to carry on their wicked designs against the prince of prophets.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="13:24"> <A HREF="Luke.html#13:24">chap. 13 ver. 24</A> 
Shall seek, etc. . .Shall desire to be saved; but for want of taking sufficient pains, and being thoroughly in earnest, shall not attain to it.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="14:26"> <A HREF="Luke.html#14:26">chap. 14 ver. 26</A> 
Hate not, etc. . .The law of Christ does not allow us to hate even our enemies, much less our parents:  but the meaning of the text is, that we must be in that disposition of soul, as to be willing to renounce, and part with every thing, how near or dear soever it may be to us, that would keep us from following Christ.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="15:10"> <A HREF="Luke.html#15:10">chap. 15 ver. 10</A> 
Before the angels. . .By this it is plain that the spirits in heaven have a concern for us below, and a joy at our repentance and consequently a knowledge of it.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="16:9"> <A HREF="Luke.html#16:9">chap. 16 ver. 9</A> 
Mammon of iniquity. . .Mammon signifies riches.  They are here called the mammon of iniquity, because oftentimes ill gotten, ill bestowed, or an occasion of evil; and at the best are but worldly, and false; and not the true riches of a Christian.  They may receive. . .By this we see, that the poor servants of God, whom we have relieved by our alms, may hereafter, by their intercession, bring our souls to heaven.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="16:22"> <A HREF="Luke.html#16:22">chap. 16 ver. 22</A> 
Abraham's bosom. . .The place of rest, where the souls of the saints resided, till Christ had opened heaven by his death.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="17:10"> <A HREF="Luke.html#17:10">chap. 17 ver. 10</A> 
Unprofitable servants. . .Because our service is of no profit to our master; and he justly claims it as our bounden duty.  But though we are unprofitable to him, our serving him is not unprofitable to us; for he is pleased to give by his grace a value to our good works, which, in consequence of his promise, entitles them to an eternal reward.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="18:3"> <A HREF="Luke.html#18:3">chap. 18 ver. 3</A> 
Avenge. . .That is, do me justice.  It is a Hebraism.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="19:13"> <A HREF="Luke.html#19:13">chap. 19 ver. 13</A> 
He gave them ten pounds. . .In the original, what is here translated a pound, is in Latin, mina, in value of our coin, three pounds two shillings and sixpence.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="22:19"> <A HREF="Luke.html#22:19">chap. 22 ver. 19</A> 
Do this for a commemoration of me. . .This sacrifice and sacrament is to be continued in the church, to the end of the world, to shew forth the death of Christ, until he cometh.  But this commemoration, or remembrance, is by no means inconsistent with the real presence of his body and blood, under these sacramental veils, which represent his death; on the contrary, it is the manner that he himself hath commanded, of commemorating and celebrating his death, by offering in sacrifice, and rec eiving in the sacrament, that body and blood by which we were redeemed.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="22:58"> <A HREF="Luke.html#22:58">chap. 22 ver. 58</A> 
Another, etc. . .Observe here, in order to reconcile the four Evangelists, that divers persons concurred in charging Peter with being Christ's disciple; till at length they brought him to deny him thrice. 1. The porteress that let him in, and afterwards seeing him at the fire, first put the question to him; and then positively affirmed that he was with Christ.  2. Another maid accused him to the standers by; and gave occasion to the man here mentioned to renew the charge against him, which caused the second denial.  3. Others of the company took notice of his being a Galilean; and were seconded by the kinsman of Malchus, who affirmed he had seen him in the garden.  And this drew on the third denial.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="23:43"> <A HREF="Luke.html#23:43">chap. 23 ver. 43</A> 
In paradise. . .That is, in the happy state of rest, joy, and peace everlasting.  Christ was pleased, by a special privilege, to reward the faith and confession of the penitent thief, with a full discharge of all his sins, both as to the guilt and punishment; and to introduce him immediately after death into the happy society of the saints, whose limbo, that is, the place of their confinement, was now made a paradise by our Lord's going thither.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="23:54"> <A HREF="Luke.html#23:54">chap. 23 ver. 54</A> 
Parasceve. . .That is, the eve, or day of preparation for the sabbath.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="24:49"> <A HREF="Luke.html#24:49">chap. 24 ver. 49</A> 
The promise of my Father. . .that is, the Holy Ghost, whom Christ had promised that his Father and he would send, John 14. 26, and 17. 7.</FONT></TD>

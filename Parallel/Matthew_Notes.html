<H2>THE NEW TESTAMENT OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST</H2>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="1:16"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#1:16">chap. 1 ver. 16</A> 
The husband of Mary. . .The Evangelist gives us rather the pedigree of St. Joseph, than that of the blessed Virgin, to conform to the custom of the Hebrews, who in their genealogies took no notice of women; but as they were near akin, the pedigree of the one sheweth that of the other.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="1:25"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#1:25">chap. 1 ver. 25</A> 
Till she brought forth her firstborn son. . .From these words Helvidius and other heretics most impiously inferred that the blessed Virgin Mary had other children besides Christ; but St. Jerome shews, by divers examples, that this expression of the Evangelist was a manner of speaking usual among the Hebrews, to denote by the word until, only what is done, without any regard to the future.  Thus it is said, Genesis 8. 6 and 7, that Noe sent forth a raven, which went forth, and did not retur n till the waters were dried up on the earth.  That is, did not return any more.  Also Isaias 46. 4, God says:  I am till you grow old.  Who dare infer that God should then cease to be:  Also in the first book of Machabees 5. 54, And they went up to mount Sion with joy and gladness, and offered holocausts, because not one of them was slain till they had returned in peace.  That is, not one was slain before or after they had returned.  God saith to his divine Son:  Sit on my right hand till I ma ke thy enemies thy footstool.  Shall he sit no longer after his enemies are subdued?  Yea and for all eternity.  St. Jerome also proves by Scripture examples, that an only begotten son, was also called firstborn, or first begotten:  because according to the law, the firstborn males were to be consecrated to God; Sanctify unto me, saith the Lord, every firstborn that openeth the womb among the children of Israel, etc.  Ex. 13. 2.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="3:2"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#3:2">chap. 3 ver. 2</A> 
Do penance. . .Paenitentiam agite.  Which word, according to the use of the scriptures and the holy fathers, does not only signify repentance and amendment of life, but also punishing past sins by fasting, and such like penitential exercises.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="3:7"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#3:7">chap. 3 ver. 7</A> 
Pharisees and Sadducees. . .These were two sects among the Jews:  of which the former were for the most part notorious hypocrites; the latter, a kind of freethinkers in matters of religion.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="4:8"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#4:8">chap. 4 ver. 8</A> 
Shewed him, etc. . .That is, pointed out to him where each kingdom lay; and set forth in words what was most glorious and admirable in each of them.  Or also set before his eyes, as it were in a large map, a lively representation of all those kingdoms.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:3"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#5:3">chap. 5 ver. 3</A> 
The poor in spirit. . .That is, the humble; and they whose spirit is not set upon riches.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:17"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#5:17">chap. 5 ver. 17</A> 
To fulfil. . .By accomplishing all the figures and prophecies; and perfecting all that was imperfect.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:18"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#5:18">chap. 5 ver. 18</A> 
Amen. . .That is, assuredly of a truth. . .This Hebrew word, amen, is here retained by the example and authority of all the four Evangelists. It is used by our Lord as a strong asseveration, and affirmation of the truth.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:20"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#5:20">chap. 5 ver. 20</A> 
The scribes and Pharisees. . .The scribes were the doctors of the law of Moses:  the Pharisees were a precise set of men, making profession of a more exact observance of the law:  and upon that account greatly esteemed among the people.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:21"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#5:21">chap. 5 ver. 21</A> 
Shall be in danger of the judgment. . .That is, shall deserve to be punished by that lesser tribunal among the Jews, called the Judgment, which took cognizance of such crimes.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:22"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#5:22">chap. 5 ver. 22</A> 
Raca. . .A word expressing great indignation or contempt.  Shall be in danger of the council. . .That is, shall deserve to be punished by the highest court of judicature, called the Council, or Sanhedrim, consisting of seventy-two persons, where the highest causes were tried and judged, which was at Jerusalem.  Thou fool. . .This was then looked upon as a heinous injury, when uttered with contempt, spite, or malice: and therefore is here so severely condemned.  Shall be in danger of hell f ire. . .literally, according to the Greek, shall deserve to be cast into the Gehenna of fire.  Which words our Saviour made use of to express the fire and punishments of hell.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:29"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#5:29">chap. 5 ver. 29</A> 
Scandalize thee. . .That is, if it be a stumblingblock, or occasion of sin to thee.  By which we are taught to fly the immediate occasions of sin, though they be as dear to us, or as necessary as a hand or an eye.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:34"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#5:34">chap. 5 ver. 34</A> 
Not to swear at all. . .It is not forbid to swear in truth, justice and judgment; to the honour of God, or our own or neighbour's just defence: but only to swear rashly, or profanely, in common discourse, and without necessity.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:39"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#5:39">chap. 5 ver. 39</A> 
Not to resist evil, etc. . .What is here commanded, is a Christian patience under injuries and affronts, and to be willing even to suffer still more, rather than to indulge the desire of revenge:  but what is further added does not strictly oblige according to the letter, for neither did Christ nor St. Paul turn the other cheek.  St. John 18., and Acts 23.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:46"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#5:46">chap. 5 ver. 46</A> 
The publicans. . .These were the gatherers of the public taxes:  a set of men, odious and infamous among the Jews, for their extortions and injustice.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="6:1"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#6:1">chap. 6 ver. 1</A> 
Your justice. . .that is, works of justice; viz., fasting, prayer, and almsdeeds; which ought to be performed not out of ostentation, or a view to please men, but solely to please God.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="6:11"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#6:11">chap. 6 ver. 11</A> 
Supersubstantial bread. . .In St. Luke the same word is rendered daily bread.  It is understood of the bread of life, which we receive in the Blessed Sacrament.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="6:13"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#6:13">chap. 6 ver. 13</A> 
Lead us not into temptation. . .That is, suffer us not to be overcome by temptation.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="6:24"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#6:24">chap. 6 ver. 24</A> 
Mammon. . .That is, riches, worldly interest.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="9:15"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#9:15">chap. 9 ver. 15</A> 
Can the children of the bridegroom. . .This, by a Hebraism, signifies the friends or companions of the bridegroom.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="10:16"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#10:16">chap. 10 ver. 16</A> 
Simple. . .That is, harmless, plain, sincere, and without guile.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="10:35"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#10:35">chap. 10 ver. 35</A> 
I came to set a man at variance, etc. . .Not that this was the end or design of the coming of our Saviour; but that his coming and his doctrine would have this effect, by reason of the obstinate resistance that many would make, and of their persecuting all such as should adhere to him.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="11:6"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#11:6">chap. 11 ver. 6</A> 
Scandalized in me. . .That is, who shall not take occasion of scandal or offence from my humility, and the disgraceful death of the cross which I shall endure.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="11:12"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#11:12">chap. 11 ver. 12</A> 
Suffereth violence, etc. . .It is not to be obtained but by main force, by using violence upon ourselves, by mortification and penance, and resisting our perverse inclinations.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="11:14"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#11:14">chap. 11 ver. 14</A> 
He is Elias, etc. . .Not in person, but in spirit.  St. Luke 1. 17.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="12:4"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#12:4">chap. 12 ver. 4</A> 
The loaves of proposition. . .So were called the twelve loaves which were placed before the sanctuary in the temple of God.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="12:31"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#12:31">chap. 12 ver. 31</A> 
The blasphemy of the Spirit. . .The sin here spoken of is that blasphemy, by which the Pharisees attributed the miracles of Christ, wrought by the Spirit of God, to Beelzebub the prince of devils.  Now this kind of sin is usually accompanied with so much obstinacy, and such wilful opposing the Spirit of God, and the known truth, that men who are guilty of it, are seldom or never converted:  and therefore are never forgiven, because they will not repent.  Otherwise there is no sin, which Go d cannot or will not forgive to such as sincerely repent, and have recourse to the keys of the church.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="12:32"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#12:32">chap. 12 ver. 32</A> 
Nor in the world to come. . .From these words St. Augustine (De Civ. Dei, lib. 21, c. 13) and St. Gregory (Dialog., 4, c. 39) gather, that some sins may be remitted in the world to come; and, consequently, that there is a purgatory or a middle place.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="12:36"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#12:36">chap. 12 ver. 36</A> 
Every idle word. . .This shews there must be a place of temporal punishment hereafter where these slighter faults shall be punished.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="12:38"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#12:38">chap. 12 ver. 38</A> 
A sign. . .That is, a miracle from heaven.  St. Luke 11. 16.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="12:40"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#12:40">chap. 12 ver. 40</A> 
Three days, etc. . .Not complete days and nights; but part of three days, and three nights taken according to the way that the Hebrews counted their days and nights, viz., from evening to evening.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="12:48"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#12:48">chap. 12 ver. 48</A> 
Who is my mother?. . .This was not spoken by way of slighting his mother, but to shew that we are never to suffer ourselves to be taken from the service of God, by any inordinate affection to our earthly parents:  and that which our Lord chiefly regarded in his mother, was her doing the will of his Father in heaven.  It may also further allude to the reprobation of the Jews, his carnal kindred, and the election of the Gentiles.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="13:55"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#13:55">chap. 13 ver. 55</A> 
His brethren. . .These were the children of Mary the wife of Cleophas, sister to our Blessed Lady, (St. Matt. 27. 56; St. John 19. 25,) and therefore, according to the usual style of the Scripture, they were called brethren, that is, near relations to our Saviour.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="14:1"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#14:1">chap. 14 ver. 1</A> 
Tetrarch. . .This word, derived from the Greek, signifies one that rules over the fourth part of a kingdom:  as Herod then ruled over Galilee, which was but the fourth part of the kingdom of his father.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="15:5"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#15:5">chap. 15 ver. 5</A> 
The gift, etc. . .That is, the offering that I shall make to God, shall be instead of that which should be expended for thy profit.  This tradition of the Pharisees was calculated to enrich themselves; by exempting children from giving any further assistance to their parents, if they once offered to the temple and the priests, that which should have been the support of their parents.  But this was a violation of the law of God, and of nature, which our Saviour here condemns.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="15:9"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#15:9">chap. 15 ver. 9</A> 
Commandments of men. . .The doctrines and commandments here reprehended are such as are either contrary to the law of God, (as that of neglecting parents, under pretence of giving to God,) or at least are frivolous, unprofitable, and no ways conducing to true piety, as that of often washing hands, etc., without regard to the purity of the heart.  But as to the rules and ordinances of the holy church, touching fasts, festivals, etc., these are no ways repugnant to, but highly agreeable to G od's holy word, and all Christian piety:  neither are they to be counted among the doctrines and commandments of men; because they proceed not from mere human authority; but from that which Christ has established in his church; whose pastors he has commanded us to hear and obey, even as himself.  St. Luke 10. 16; St. Matt. 18. 17.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="15:11"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#15:11">chap. 15 ver. 11</A> 
Not that which goeth into, etc. . .No uncleanness in meat, nor any dirt contracted by eating it with unwashed hands, can defile the soul:  but sin alone; or a disobedience of the heart to the ordinance and will of God.  And thus when Adam took the forbidden fruit, it was not the apple, which entered into the mouth, but the disobedience to the law of God which defiled him.  The same is to be said if a Jew, in the time of the old law, had eaten swine's flesh; or a Christian convert, in the d ays of the apostles, contrary to their ordinance, had eaten blood; or if any of the faithful at present should transgress the ordinance of God's church, by breaking the fasts:  for in all these cases the soul would be defiled; not indeed by that which goeth into the mouth; but by the disobedience of the heart, in wilfully transgressing the ordinance of God, or of those who have their authority from him.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="16:18"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#16:18">chap. 16 ver. 18</A> 
 Thou art Peter, etc. . .As St. Peter, by divine revelation, here made a solemn profession of his faith of the divinity of Christ; so in recompense of this faith and profession, our Lord here declares to him the dignity to which he is pleased to raise him:  viz., that he to whom he had already given the name of Peter, signifying a rock, St. John 1. 42, should be a rock indeed, of invincible strength, for the support of the building of the church; in which building he should be, next to Chr ist himself, the chief foundation stone, in quality of chief pastor, ruler, and governor; and should have accordingly all fulness of ecclesiastical power, signified by the keys of the kingdom of heaven.  Upon this rock, etc. . .The words of Christ to Peter, spoken in the vulgar language of the Jews which our Lord made use of, were the same as if he had said in English, Thou art a Rock, and upon this rock I will build my church.  So that, by the plain course of the words, Peter is here declared to be the rock, upon which the church was to be built: Christ himself being both the principal foundation and founder of the same.  Where also note, that Christ, by building his house, that is, his church, upon a rock, has thereby secured it against all storms and floods, like the wise builder, St. Matt. 7. 24, 25. The gates of hell, etc. . .That is, the powers of darkness, and whatever Satan can do, either by himself, or his agents.  For as the church is here likened to a house, or fortress, b uilt on a rock; so the adverse powers are likened to a contrary house or fortress, the gates of which, that is, the whole strength, and all the efforts it can make, will never be able to prevail over the city or church of Christ.  By this promise we are fully assured, that neither idolatry, heresy, nor any pernicious error whatsoever shall at any time prevail over the church of Christ.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="16:19"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#16:19">chap. 16 ver. 19</A> 
Loose on earth. . .The loosing the bands of temporal punishments due to sins, is called an indulgence; the power of which is here granted.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="16:22"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#16:22">chap. 16 ver. 22</A> 
And Peter taking him. . .That is, taking him aside, out of a tender love, respect and zeal for his Lord and Master's honour, began to expostulate with him, as it were to rebuke him, saying, Lord, far be it from thee to suffer death; but the Lord said to Peter, ver. 23, Go behind me, Satan.  These words may signify, Begone from me; but the holy Fathers expound them otherwise, that is, come after me, or follow me; and by these words the Lord would have Peter to follow him in his suffering, a nd not to oppose the divine will by contradiction; for the word satan means in Hebrew an adversary, or one that opposes.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="17:19"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#17:19">chap. 17 ver. 19</A> 
As a grain of mustard seed. . .That is, a perfect faith; which in its properties, and its fruits, resembles the grain of mustard seed, in the parable, chap. 13. 31.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="17:23"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#17:23">chap. 17 ver. 23</A> 
The didrachmas. . .A didrachma was half a sicle, or half a stater; that is, about 15d. English:  which was a tax laid upon every head for the service of the temple.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="18:6"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#18:6">chap. 18 ver. 6</A> 
Shall scandalize. . .That is, shall put a stumblingblock in their way, and cause them to fall into sin.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="18:7"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#18:7">chap. 18 ver. 7</A> 
It must needs be, etc. . .Viz., considering the wickedness and corruption of the world.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="18:8"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#18:8">chap. 18 ver. 8</A> 
Scandalize thee. . .That is, cause thee to offend.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="18:20"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#18:20">chap. 18 ver. 20</A> 
There am I in the midst of them. . .This is understood of such assemblies only as are gathered in the name and authority of Christ; and in unity of the church of Christ.  St. Cyprian, De Unitate Ecclesiae.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="18:24"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#18:24">chap. 18 ver. 24</A> 
Talents. . .A talent was seven hundred and fifty ounces of silver, which at the rate of five shillings to the ounce is a hundred and eighty-seven pounds ten shillings sterling.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="18:28"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#18:28">chap. 18 ver. 28</A> 
Pence. . .The Roman penny was the eighth part of an ounce, that is, about sevenpence half-penny English.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="19:9"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#19:9">chap. 19 ver. 9</A> 
Except it be, etc. . .In the case of fornication, that is, of adultery, the wife may be put away:  but even then the husband cannot marry another as long as the wife is living.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="19:11"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#19:11">chap. 19 ver. 11</A> 
All men take not this word. . .That is, all receive not the gift of living singly and chastely, unless they pray for the grace of God to enable them to live so, and for some it may be necessary to that end to fast as well as pray:  and to those it is given from above.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="19:12"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#19:12">chap. 19 ver. 12</A> 
There are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs, for the kingdom of heaven. . .This text is not to be taken in the literal sense; but means, that there are such, who have taken a firm and commendable resolution of leading a single and chaste life, in order to serve God in a more perfect state than those who marry:  as St. Paul clearly shews.  1 Cor. 7. 37, 38.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="20:15"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#20:15">chap. 20 ver. 15</A> 
What I will. . .Viz., with my own, and in matters that depend on my own bounty.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="22:16"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#22:16">chap. 22 ver. 16</A> 
The Herodians. . .That is, some that belonged to Herod, and that joined with him in standing up for the necessity of paying tribute to Caesar, that is, to the Roman emperor.  Some are of opinion that there was a sect among the Jews called Herodians, from their maintaining that Herod was the Messias.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="23:5"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#23:5">chap. 23 ver. 5</A> 
Phylacteries. . .that is, parchments, on which they wrote the ten commandments, and carried them on their foreheads before their eyes: which the Pharisees affected to wear broader than other men; so to seem more zealous for the law.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="23:9"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#23:9">chap. 23 ver. 9</A> 
Call none your father--Neither be ye called masters, etc. . .The meaning is that our Father in heaven is incomparably more to be regarded, than any father upon earth:  and no master to be followed, who would lead us away from Christ.  But this does not hinder but that we are by the law of God to have a due respect both for our parents and spiritual fathers, (1 Cor. 4. 23:15,) and for our masters and teachers.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="23:29"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#23:29">chap. 23 ver. 29</A> 
Build the sepulchres, etc. . .This is not blamed, as if it were in itself evil to build or adorn the monuments of the prophets:  but the hypocrisy of the Pharisees is here taxed; who, whilst they pretended to honour the memory of the prophets, were persecuting even unto death the Lord of the prophets.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="23:35"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#23:35">chap. 23 ver. 35</A> 
That upon you may come, etc. . .Not that they should suffer more than their own sins justly deserved; but that the justice of God should now fall upon them with such a final vengeance, once for all, as might comprise all the different kinds of judgments and punishments, that had at any time before been inflicted for the shedding of just blood.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="24:28"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#24:28">chap. 24 ver. 28</A> 
Wheresoever, etc. . .The coming of Christ shall be sudden, and manifest to all the world, like lightning:  and wheresoever he shall come, thither shall all mankind be gathered to him, as eagles are gathered about a dead body.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="24:29"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#24:29">chap. 24 ver. 29</A> 
The stars. . .Or flaming meteors resembling stars.</FONT></TD>

Me you have not always. . .Viz., in a visible manner, as when conversant here on earth; and as we have the poor, whom we may daily assist and relieve.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="26:17"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#26:17">chap. 26 ver. 17</A>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="26:26"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#26:26">chap. 26 ver. 26</A> 
This is my body. . .He does not say, This is the figure of my body--but This is my body.  (2 Council of Nice, Act. 6.)  Neither does he say in this, or with this is my body; but absolutely, This is my body:  which plainly implies transubstantiation.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="26:27"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#26:27">chap. 26 ver. 27</A> 
Drink ye all of this. . .This was spoken to the twelve apostles; who were the all then present; and they all drank of it, says St. Mark 14. 23. But it no ways follows from these words spoken to the apostles, that all the faithful are here commanded to drink of the chalice; any more than that all the faithful are commanded to consecrate, offer and administer this sacrament; because Christ upon this same occasion, and at the same time, bid the apostles do so; in these words, St. Luke 22. 19, Do this for a commemoration of me.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="26:28"> <A HREF="Matthew.html#26:28">chap. 26 ver. 28</A> 
Blood of the new testament. . .As the old testament was dedicated with the blood of victims, by Moses, in these words:  This is the blood of the testament, etc., Heb. 9. 20; so here is the dedication and institution of the new testament, in the blood of Christ, here mystically shed by these words:  This is the blood of the new testament, etc.</FONT></TD>

Fruit of the vine. . .These words, by the account of St. Luke 26:22. 18, were not spoken of the sacramental cup, but of the wine that was drunk with the paschal lamb.  Though the sacramental cup might also be called the fruit of the vine, because it was consecrated from wine, and retains the likeness, and all the accidents or qualities of wine.</FONT></TD>

All power, etc. . .See here the warrant and commission of the apostles and their successors, the bishops and pastors of Christ's church.  He received from his Father all power in heaven and in earth:  and in virtue of this power, he sends them (even as his Father sent him, St. John 20. 21) to teach and disciple, not one, but all nations; and instruct them in all truths:  and that he may assist them effectually in the execution of this commission, he promises to be with them, not for three or four hundred years only, but all days, even to the consummation of the world.  How then could the Catholic Church ever go astray; having always with her pastors, as is here promised, Christ himself, who is the way, the truth, and the life.  St. John 14.</FONT></TD>

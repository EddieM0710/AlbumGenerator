<P>
The original desire that lead to this parallel version was to be able to print a
few pages of Latin and English text side by side to aid in learning Latin.  I experimented
with several methods most to which where very cumbursome or did not provide satisfying results.
Eventually, I wrote a simple computer program that put the English and Latin
into a standard format and then formatted these into
a single parallel html version of the Bible.
<P>
This electronic text was created from Douay Rheims and the Latin Vulgate
translations that are freely available on the Internet.  I strove to maintain the
accuracy of the original texts as I found them
(and I believe I did), however, the resulting accuracy is only as good as the original
texts. The Internet being the massive confusion that it is, I have no idea exactly
how accurate the original versions were but what I have compared to published texts
has been accurate.  The entire text has not been reviewed; indeed, I have reviewed only
the smallest fraction.
<P>
Both the original versions are public domain as far as I can determine.  I take no
credit and ask for no recognition for this translation since my only addition was in the formating.
I do ask that recognition go to all those good men and women through history who
loved God and their fellow man enough to make the effort to faithfully pass God's Word on to us.

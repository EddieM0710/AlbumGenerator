The fault is not so great, etc. . .The sin of theft is not so great, as to be compared with adultery:  especially when a person pressed with hunger (which is the case here spoken of) steals to satisfy nature. Moreover the damage done by theft may much more easily be repaired, than the wrong done by adultery.  But this does not hinder, but that theft also is a mortal sin, forbidden by one of the ten commandments.</FONT></TD>

It is the part of man, etc. . .That is, a man should prepare in his heart and soul what he is to say:  but after all, it must be the Lord that must govern his tongue, to speak to the purpose.  Not that we can think any thing of good without God's grace; but that after we have (with God's grace) thought and prepared within our souls what we would speak, if God does not govern our tongue, we shall not succeed in what we speak.</FONT></TD>

Majesty. . .Viz., of God.  For to search into that incomprehensible Majesty, and to pretend to sound the depths of the wisdom of God, is exposing our weak understanding to be blinded with an excess of light and glory, which it cannot comprehend.</FONT></TD>

Gatherer, etc. . .Or, as it is in the Latin, Congregans the son of Vomens.  The Latin interpreter has given us in this place the signification of the Hebrew names, instead of the names themselves, which are in the Hebrew, Agur the son of Jakeh.  But whether this Agur be the same person as Solomon, as many think, or a different person, whose doctrine was adopted by Solomon, and inserted among his parables or proverbs, is uncertain.</FONT></TD>

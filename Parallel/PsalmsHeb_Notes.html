Unto the end. . .Or, as St. Jerome renders it, victori, to him that overcometh:  which some understand of the chief musician; to whom they suppose the psalms, which bear that title, were given to be sung:  we rather understand the psalms thus inscribed to refer to Christ, who is the end of the law, and the great conqueror of death and hell, and to the New Testament.--Ibid.  In verses, in carminibus. . .In the Hebrew, it is neghinoth, supposed by some to be a musical instrument, with which this psalm was to be sung.--Ibid.  For David, or to David. . .That is, inspired to David himself, or to be sung.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:1"> <A HREF="PsalmsHeb.html#5:1">chap. 5 ver. 1</A> 
For her that obtaineth the inheritance. . .That is, for the church of Christ.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="6:1"> <A HREF="PsalmsHeb.html#6:1">chap. 6 ver. 1</A> 
For the octave. . .That is, to be sung on an instrument of eight strings.  St. Augustine understands it mystically, of the last resurrection, and the world to come; which is, as it were, the octave, or eighth day, after the seven days of this mortal life:  and for this octave, sinners must dispose themselves, like David, by bewailing their sins, whilst they are here upon earth.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="7:14"> <A HREF="PsalmsHeb.html#7:14">chap. 7 ver. 14</A> 
For them that burn. . .That is, against the persecutors of his saints.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="8:1"> <A HREF="PsalmsHeb.html#8:1">chap. 8 ver. 1</A> 
The presses. . .In Hebrew, Gittith, supposed to be a musical instrument.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="9:1"> <A HREF="PsalmsHeb.html#9:1">chap. 9 ver. 1</A> 
The hidden things of the Son. . .The humility and sufferings of Christ, the Son of God; and of good Christians, who are his sons by adoption; are called hidden things, with regard to the children of this world, who know not the value and merit of them.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="9:21"> <A HREF="PsalmsHeb.html#9:21">chap. 9 ver. 21</A> 
Here the late Hebrew doctors divide this psalm into two, making ver. 22 the beginning of Psalm 10.  And again they join Psalms 146 and 147 into one, in order that the whole number of psalms should not exceed 150. And in this manner the psalms are numbered in the Protestant Bible.  Psalm 9a = 10 according to the Hebrews.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="15:1"> <A HREF="PsalmsHeb.html#15:1">chap. 15 ver. 1</A> 
The inscription of a title. . .That is, of a pillar or monument, staylographia:  which is as much as to say, that this psalm is most worthy to be engraved on an everlasting monument.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="16:10"> <A HREF="PsalmsHeb.html#16:10">chap. 16 ver. 10</A> 
Their fat. . .That is, their bowels of compassion:  for they have none for me.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="16:14"> <A HREF="PsalmsHeb.html#16:14">chap. 16 ver. 14</A> 
Divide them from the few, etc. . .That is, cut them off from the earth, and the few trifling things thereof; which they are so proud of, or divide them from the few; that is, from thy elect, who are but few; that they may no longer have it in their power to oppress them.  It is not meant by way of a curse or imprecation; but, as many other the like passages in the psalms, by way of a prediction, or prophecy of what should come upon them, in punishment of their wickedness.  Ibid.  Thy hidde n stores. . .Thy secret treasures, out of which thou furnishest those earthly goods, which, with a bountiful hand thou hast distributed both to the good and the bad.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="19:7"> <A HREF="PsalmsHeb.html#19:7">chap. 19 ver. 7</A>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="20:13"> <A HREF="PsalmsHeb.html#20:13">chap. 20 ver. 13</A> 
In thy remnants thou shalt prepare their face. . .Or thou shalt set thy remnants against their faces.  That is, thou shalt make them see what punishments remain for them hereafter from thy justice.  Instead of remnants, St. Jerome renders it funes, that is, cords or strings, viz., of the bow of divine justice, from which God directs his arrows against the faces of his enemies.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="21:2"> <A HREF="PsalmsHeb.html#21:2">chap. 21 ver. 2</A>

Shall reduce them to pieces, etc. . .In Hebrew, shall make them to skip like a calf.  The psalmist here describes the effects of thunder (which he calls the voice of the Lord) which sometimes breaks down the tallest and strongest trees; and makes their broken branches skip, etc.  All this is to be understood mystically of the powerful voice of God's word in his church; which has broken the pride of the great ones of this world, and brought many of them meekly and joyfully to submit their n ecks to the sweet yoke of Christ.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="31:3"> <A HREF="PsalmsHeb.html#31:3">chap. 31 ver. 3</A>

I am turned, etc. . .That is, I turn and roll about in my bed to seek for ease in my pain whilst the thorn of thy justice pierces my flesh, and sticks fast in me.  Or, I am turned:  that is, I am converted to thee, my God, by being brought to a better understanding by thy chastisements.  In the Hebrew it is, my moisture is turned into the droughts of the summer.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="35:3"> <A HREF="PsalmsHeb.html#35:3">chap. 35 ver. 3</A> 
Unto hatred. . .That is, hateful to God.</FONT></TD>

The meaning of this verse is, Why should I now indulge those passions and sinful affections, or commit now those sins, which will cause me so much fear and anguish in the evil day; when the sorrows of death shall compass me, and the perils of hell shall find me?</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="48:7"> <A HREF="PsalmsHeb.html#48:7">chap. 48 ver. 7</A> 
They that trust, etc. . .As much as to say, let them fear that trust in their strength or riches:  for they have great reason to fear:  seeing no brother or other man, how much a friend soever, can by any price or labour rescue them from death.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="48:9"> <A HREF="PsalmsHeb.html#48:9">chap. 48 ver. 9</A> 
And shall labour for ever, etc. . .This seems to be a continuation of the foregoing sentence:  as much as to say no man can by any price or ransom prolong his life, that so he may still continue to labour here, and live to the end of the world.  Others understand it of the eternal sorrows, and dying life of hell, which is the dreadful consequence of dying in sin.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="48:11"> <A HREF="PsalmsHeb.html#48:11">chap. 48 ver. 11</A> 
He shall not see destruction, etc. . .Or, shall he not see destruction? As much as to say, however thoughtless he may be of his death, he must not expect to escape; when even the wise and the good are not exempt from dying.</FONT></TD>

Let death, etc. . .This, and such like imprecations which occur in the psalms, are delivered prophetically; that is, by way of foretelling the punishments which shall fall upon the wicked from divine justice, and approving the righteous ways of God:  but not by way of ill will, or uncharitable curses, which the law of God disallows.</FONT></TD>

But as this psalm evidently relates to Christ, and the New Testament, where the ark has no place, the holy fathers understand this text, of the worship paid by the church to the body and blood of Christ in the sacred mysteries:  inasmuch as the humanity of Christ is, as it were, the footstool of the divinity.

<H2>THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS</H2>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="1:4"> <A HREF="Romans.html#1:4">chap. 1 ver. 4</A> 
Predestinated, etc. . .Christ as man, was predestinated to be the Son of God:  and declared to be so (as the apostle here signifies) first, by power, that is, by his working stupendous miracles; secondly, by the spirit of sanctification, that is, by his infinite sanctity; thirdly, by his ressurection, or raising himself from the dead.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="1:26"> <A HREF="Romans.html#1:26">chap. 1 ver. 26</A> 
God delivered them up. . .Not by being author of their sins, but by withdrawing his grace, and so permitting them, in punishment of their pride, to fall into those shameful sins.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="3:4"> <A HREF="Romans.html#3:4">chap. 3 ver. 4</A> 
God only is essentially true.  All men in their own capacity are liable to lies and errors:  nevertheless God, who is the truth, will make good his promise of keeping his church in all truth.  See St. John 16.13.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="3:10"> <A HREF="Romans.html#3:10">chap. 3 ver. 10</A> 
There is not any man just, viz. . .by virtue either of the law of nature, or of the law of Moses; but only by faith and grace.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="3:28"> <A HREF="Romans.html#3:28">chap. 3 ver. 28</A> 
By faith, etc. . .The faith, to which the apostle here attributes man's justification, is not a presumptuous assurance of our being justified; but a firm and lively belief of all that God has revealed or promised. Heb. 11.  A faith working through charity in Jesus Christ.  Gal. 5.6. In short, a faith which takes in hope, love, repentance, and the use of the sacraments.  And the works which he here excludes, are only the works of the law:  that is, such as are done by the law of nature, or that of Moses, antecedent to the faith of Christ:  but by no means, such as follow faith, and proceed from it.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="4:2"> <A HREF="Romans.html#4:2">chap. 4 ver. 2</A> 
By works. . .Done by his own strength, without the grace of God, and faith in him.  Not before God. . .Whatever glory or applause such works might procure from men, they would be of no value in the sight of God.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="4:3"> <A HREF="Romans.html#4:3">chap. 4 ver. 3</A> 
Reputed, etc. . .By God, who reputeth nothing otherwise than it is. However, we may gather from this word, that when we are justified, our justification proceedeth from God's free grace and bounty; and not from any efficacy which any act of ours could have of its own nature, abstracting from God's grace.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="4:4"> <A HREF="Romans.html#4:4">chap. 4 ver. 4</A> 
To him that worketh. . .Vis., as of his own fund, or by his own strength.  Such a man, says the apostle, challenges his reward as a debt due to his own performances; whereas he who worketh not, that is, who presumeth not upon any works done by his own strength, but seeketh justice through faith and grace, is freely justified by God's grace.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="4:7"> <A HREF="Romans.html#4:7">chap. 4 ver. 7</A> 
Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. . .That is, blessed are those who, by doing penance, have obtained pardon and remission of their sins, and also are covered; that is, newly clothed with the habit of grace, and vested with the stole of charity.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="4:8"> <A HREF="Romans.html#4:8">chap. 4 ver. 8</A> 
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin. . .That is, blessed is the man who hath retained his baptismal innocence, that no grievous sin can be imputed to him.  And, likewise, blessed is the man, who after fall into sin, hath done penance and leads a virtuous life, by frequenting the sacraments necessary for obtaining the grace to prevent a relapse, that sin is no more imputed to him.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="4:9"> <A HREF="Romans.html#4:9">chap. 4 ver. 9</A> 
In the circumcision, etc. . .That is, is it only for the Jews that are circumcised?  No, says the apostle, but also for the uncircumcised Gentiles:  who, by faith and grace, may come to justice; as Abraham did before he was circumcised.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="4:14"> <A HREF="Romans.html#4:14">chap. 4 ver. 14</A> 
Be heirs. . .That is, if they alone, who follow the ceremonies of the law, be heirs of the blessings promised to Abraham; then that faith which was so much praised in him, will be found to be of little value. And the very promise will be made void, by which he was promised to be the father, not of the Jews only, but of all nations of believers.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="4:15"> <A HREF="Romans.html#4:15">chap. 4 ver. 15</A> 
The law worketh wrath. . .The law, abstracting from faith and grace, worketh wrath occasionally, by being an occasion of many transgressions, which provoke God's wrath.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:12"> <A HREF="Romans.html#5:12">chap. 5 ver. 12</A> 
By one man. . .Adam, from whom we all contracted original sin.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:13"> <A HREF="Romans.html#5:13">chap. 5 ver. 13</A> 
Not imputed. . .That is, men knew not, or made no account of sin, neither was it imputed to them, in the manner it was afterwards, when they transgressed the known written law of God.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:20"> <A HREF="Romans.html#5:20">chap. 5 ver. 20</A> 
That sin might abound. . .Not as if the law were given on purpose for sin to abound:  but that it so happened through man's perversity, taking occasion of sinning more, from the prohibition of sin.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="6:6"> <A HREF="Romans.html#6:6">chap. 6 ver. 6</A> 
Old man--body of sin. . .Our corrupt state, subject to sin and concupiscence, coming to us from Adam, is called our old man, as our state, reformed in and by Christ, is called the new man.  And the vices and sins, which then ruled in us are named the body of sin.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="7:1"> <A HREF="Romans.html#7:1">chap. 7 ver. 1</A> 
As long as it liveth;. . .or, as long as he liveth.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="7:8"> <A HREF="Romans.html#7:8">chap. 7 ver. 8</A> 
Sin taking occasion. . .Sin, or concupiscence, which is called sin, because it is from sin, and leads to sin, which was asleep before, was weakened by the prohibition:  the law not being the cause thereof, nor properly giving occasion to it:  but occasion being taken by our corrupt nature to resist the commandment laid upon us.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="7:13"> <A HREF="Romans.html#7:13">chap. 7 ver. 13</A> 
That it may appear sin, or that sin may appear, viz. . .To be the monster it is, which is even capable to take occasion from that which is good, to work death.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="7:15"> <A HREF="Romans.html#7:15">chap. 7 ver. 15</A> 
I do not that good which I will, etc. . .The apostle here describes the disorderly motions of passion and concupiscence; which oftentimes in us get the start of reason:  and by means of which even good men suffer in the inferior appetite what their will abhors:  and are much hindered in the accomplishment of the desires of their spirit and mind.  But these evil motions, (though they are called the law of sin, because they come from original sin, and violently tempt and incline to sin,) as long as the will does not consent to them, are not sins, because they are not voluntary.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="8:16"> <A HREF="Romans.html#8:16">chap. 8 ver. 16</A> 
The Spirit himself, etc. . .By the inward motions of divine love, and the peace of conscience, which the children of God experience, they have a kind of testimony of God's favour; by which they are much strengthened in their hope of their justification and salvation; but yet not so as to pretend to an absolute assurance:  which is not usually granted in this mortal life:  during which we are taught to work out our salvation with fear and trembling.  Phil. 2.12.  And that he that thinketh h imself to stand, must take heed lest he fall.  1 Cor. 10.12. See also, Rom. 11.20, 21, 22.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="8:19"> <A HREF="Romans.html#8:19">chap. 8 ver. 19</A> 
The expectation of the creature, etc. . .He speaks of the corporeal creation, made for the use and service of man; and, by occasion of his sin, made subject to vanity, that is, to a perpetual instability, tending to corruption and other defects; so that by a figure of speech it is here said to groan and be in labour, and to long for its deliverance, which is then to come, when sin shall reign no more; and God shall raise the bodies and unite them to their souls never more to separate, and to be in everlasting happiness in heaven.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="8:26"> <A HREF="Romans.html#8:26">chap. 8 ver. 26</A> 
Asketh for us. . .The Spirit is said to ask, and desire for the saints, and to pray in us; inasmuch as he inspireth prayer, and teacheth us to pray.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="8:29"> <A HREF="Romans.html#8:29">chap. 8 ver. 29</A> 
He also predestinated, etc. . .That is, God hath preordained that all his elect should be conformable to the image of his Son.  We must not here offer to pry into the secrets of God's eternal election; only firmly believe that all our good, in time and eternity, flows originally from God's free goodness; and all our evil from man's free will.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="8:38"> <A HREF="Romans.html#8:38">chap. 8 ver. 38</A> 
I am sure. . .That is, I am persuaded; as it is in the Greek, pepeismai.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="9:3"> <A HREF="Romans.html#9:3">chap. 9 ver. 3</A> 
Anathema;. . .A curse.  The apostle's concern and love for his countrymen the Jews was so great, that he was willing to suffer even an anathema, or curse, for their sake; or any evil that could come upon him, without his offending God.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="9:6"> <A HREF="Romans.html#9:6">chap. 9 ver. 6</A> 
All are not Israelites, etc. . .Not all, who are the carnal seed of Israel, are true Israelites in God's account:  who, as by his free grace, he heretofore preferred Isaac before Ismael, and Jacob before Esau, so he could, and did by the like free grace, election and mercy, raise up spiritual children by faith to Abraham and Israel, from among the Gentiles, and prefer them before the carnal Jews.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="9:11"> <A HREF="Romans.html#9:11">chap. 9 ver. 11</A> 
Not yet born, etc. . .By this example of these twins, and the preference of the younger to the elder, the drift of the apostle is, to shew that God, in his election, mercy and grace, is not tied to any particular nation, as the Jews imagined; nor to any prerogative of birth, or any forgoing merits.  For as, antecedently to his grace, he sees no merits in any, but finds all involved in sin, in the common mass of condemnation; and all children of wrath:  there is no one whom he might not jus tly leave in that mass; so that whomsoever he delivers from it, he delivers in his mercy:  and whomsoever he leaves in it, he leaves in his justice.  As when, of two equally criminal, the king is pleased out of pure mercy to pardon one, whilst he suffers justice to take place in the execution of the other.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="9:16"> <A HREF="Romans.html#9:16">chap. 9 ver. 16</A> 
Not of him that willeth, etc. . .That is, by any power or strength of his own, abstracting from the grace of God.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="9:17"> <A HREF="Romans.html#9:17">chap. 9 ver. 17</A> 
To this purpose, etc. . .Not that God made him on purpose that he should sin, and so be damned; but foreseeing his obstinacy in sin, and the abuse of his own free will, he raised him up to be a mighty king, to make a more remarkable example of him:  and that his power might be better known, and his justice in punishing him, published throughout the earth.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="9:18"> <A HREF="Romans.html#9:18">chap. 9 ver. 18</A> 
He hardeneth. . .Not by being the cause or author of his sin, but by withholding his grace, and so leaving him in his sin, in punishment of his past demerits.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="9:21"> <A HREF="Romans.html#9:21">chap. 9 ver. 21</A> 
The potter. . .This similitude is used only to shew that we are not to dispute with our Maker, nor to reason with him why he does not give as much grace to one as to another; for since the whole lump of our clay is vitiated by sin, it is owing to his goodness and mercy, that he makes out of it so many vessels of honor; and it is no more than just, that others, in punishment of their unrepented sins, should be given up to be vessels of dishonor.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="9:27"> <A HREF="Romans.html#9:27">chap. 9 ver. 27</A> 
A remnant. . .That is, a small number only of the children of Israel shall be converted and saved.  How perversely is this text quoted for the salvation of men of all religions, when it speaks only of the converts of the children of Israel!</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="10:3"> <A HREF="Romans.html#10:3">chap. 10 ver. 3</A> 
The justice of God. . .That is, the justice which God giveth us through Christ; as on the other hand, the Jews' own justice is, that which they pretended to by their own strength, or by the observance of the law, without faith in Christ.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="10:9"> <A HREF="Romans.html#10:9">chap. 10 ver. 9</A> 
Thou shalt be saved. . .To confess the Lord Jesus, and to call upon the name of the Lord (ver. 13) is not barely the professing a belief in the person of Christ; but moreover, implies a belief of his whole doctrine, and an obedience to his law; without which, the calling him Lord will save no man.  St. Matt. 7.21.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="10:15"> <A HREF="Romans.html#10:15">chap. 10 ver. 15</A> 
Unless they be sent. . .Here is an evident proof against all new teachers, who have all usurped to themselves the ministry without any lawful mission, derived by succession from the apostles, to whom Christ said, John 20.21, As my Father hath sent me, I also send you.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="11:4"> <A HREF="Romans.html#11:4">chap. 11 ver. 4</A> 
Seven thousand, etc. . .This is very ill alleged by some, against the perpetual visibility of the church of Christ; the more, because however the number of the faithful might be abridged by the persecution of Jezabel in the kingdom of the ten tribes, the church was at the same time in a most flourishing condition (under Asa and Josaphat) in the kingdom of Judah.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="11:6"> <A HREF="Romans.html#11:6">chap. 11 ver. 6</A> 
It is not now by works, etc. . .If salvation were to come by works, done by nature, without faith and grace, salvation would not be a grace or favour, but a debt; but such dead works are indeed of no value in the sight of God towards salvation.  It is not the same with regard to works done with, and by, God's grace; for to such works as these, he has promised eternal salvation.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="11:8"> <A HREF="Romans.html#11:8">chap. 11 ver. 8</A> 
God hath given them, etc. . .Not by his working or acting in them; but by his permission, and by withdrawing his grace in punishment of their obstinacy.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="11:11"> <A HREF="Romans.html#11:11">chap. 11 ver. 11</A> 
That they should fall. . .The nation of the Jews is not absolutely and without remedy cast off for ever; but in part only, (many thousands of them having been at first converted,) and for a time; which fall of theirs, God has been pleased to turn to the good of the Gentiles.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="11:20"> <A HREF="Romans.html#11:20">chap. 11 ver. 20</A> 
Thou standest by faith:  be not highminded, but fear. . .We see here that he who standeth by faith may fall from it; and therefore must live in fear, and not in the vain presumption and security of modern sectaries.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="11:22"> <A HREF="Romans.html#11:22">chap. 11 ver. 22</A> 
Otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. . .The Gentiles are here admonished not to be proud, nor to glory against the Jews:  but to take occasion rather from their fall to fear and to be humble, lest they be cast off.  Not that the whole church of Christ can ever fall from him; having been secured by so many divine promises in holy writ; but that each one in particular may fall; and therefore all in general are to be admonished to beware of that, which may happen to any one in particular.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="11:29"> <A HREF="Romans.html#11:29">chap. 11 ver. 29</A> 
For the gifts and the calling of God are without. . .his repenting himself of them; for the promises of God are unchangeable, nor can he repent of conferring his gifts.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="11:32"> <A HREF="Romans.html#11:32">chap. 11 ver. 32</A> 
Concluded all in unbelief. . .He hath found all nations, both Jews and Gentiles, in unbelief and sin; not by his causing, but by the abuse of their own free will; so that their calling and election is purely owing to his mercy.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="14:2"> <A HREF="Romans.html#14:2">chap. 14 ver. 2</A> 
Eat all things. . .Viz., without observing the distinction of clean and unclean meats, prescribed by the law of Moses:  which was now no longer obligatory.  Some weak Christians, converted from among the Jews, as we here gather from the apostle, made a scruple of eating such meats as were deemed unclean by the law; such as swine's flesh, etc., which the stronger sort of Christians did eat without scruple.  Now the apostle, to reconcile them together, exhorts the former not to judge or cond emn the latter, using their Christian liberty; and the latter, to take care not to despise or scandalize their weaker brethren, either by bringing them to eat what in their conscience they think they should not, or by giving them such offence, as to endanger the driving them thereby from the Christian religion.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="14:5"> <A HREF="Romans.html#14:5">chap. 14 ver. 5</A> 
Between day, etc. . .Still observing the sabbaths and festivals of the law.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="14:23"> <A HREF="Romans.html#14:23">chap. 14 ver. 23</A> 
Discerneth. . .That is, distinguisheth between meats, and eateth against his conscience, what he deems unclean.  Of faith. . .By faith is here understood judgment and conscience:  to act against which is always a sin.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="15:8"> <A HREF="Romans.html#15:8">chap. 15 ver. 8</A> 
Minister of the circumcision. . .That is, executed his office and ministry towards the Jews, the people of the circumcision.</FONT></TD>

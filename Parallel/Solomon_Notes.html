Draw me. . .That is, with thy grace:  otherwise I should not be able to come to thee.  This metaphor shews that we cannot of ourselves come to Christ our Lord, unless he draws us by his grace, which is laid up in his storerooms:  that is, in the mysteries of Faith, which God in his goodness and love for mankind hath revealed, first by his servant Moses in the Old Law in figure only, and afterwards in reality by his only begotten Son Jesus Christ.</FONT></TD>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="4:5"> <A HREF="Solomon.html#4:5">chap. 4 ver. 5</A> 
Thy two breasts, etc. . .Mystically to be understood:  the love of God and the love of our neighbour, which are so united as twins which feed among the lilies:  that is, the love of God and our neighbour, feeds on the divine mysteries and the holy sacraments, left by Christ to his spouse to feed and nourish her children.</FONT></TD>

<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="5:10"> <A HREF="Solomon.html#5:10">chap. 5 ver. 10</A>

My beloved is gone down into his garden. . .Christ, pleased with the good works of his holy and devout servants labouring in his garden, is always present with them:  but the words is gone down, are to be understood, that after trying his Church by permitting persecution, he comes to her assistance and she rejoices at his coming.</FONT></TD>

Who is this, etc. . .The angels with admiration behold the Gentiles converted to the faith:  coming up from the desert, that is, coming from heathenism and false worship:  flowing with delights, that is, abounding with good works which are pleasing to God:  leaning on her beloved, on the promise of Christ to his Church, that the gates of hell should not prevail against it; and supported by his grace conferred by the sacraments.

All the land shall return, etc. . .This, in some measure, was verified by the means of the Machabees:  but is rather to be taken in a spiritual sense, as relating to the propagation of the church, and kingdom of Christ, the true Jerusalem, which alone shall never fall under the anathema of destruction, or God's curse.</FONT></TD>
<p><FONT size=-1><A NAME="14:12"> <A HREF="Zacharias.html#14:12">chap. 14 ver. 12</A>

They that shall be left, etc. . .That is, many of them that persecuted the church shall be converted to its faith and communion.--Ibid.  To keep the feast of tabernacles. . .This feast was kept by the Jews in memory of their sojourning forty years in the desert, in their way to the land of promise.

And they that neglect this must not look for the kind showers of divine grace, to give fruitfulness to their souls.</FONT></TD>

That which is upon the bridle, etc. . .The golden ornaments of the bridles, etc., shall be turned into offerings in the house of God.

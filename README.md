# AlbumGenerator

This is an application for maintaining an inventory and want list of stamps and visually creating a stamp album. It is designed to be cross platform but, as of now, has only been run on Linux Mint.

The intention is that this App will be completely free. The input data is not propritary, the output is Open Office text document file (.odt) which can be read and printed with open source software, and the development environment tools and libraries are open source.

Current State:<br>
It is in an early state of developmet but is starting to be useable. That means there is still a lot to implement, and has had very little testing except for main paths.

Development Environment:<br>

    <li>VSCode,<br>
